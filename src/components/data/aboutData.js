export const aboutMe = ` is my name. I am Nigerian,
          born and raised in Nigeria, and currently living in Estonia. I find
          joy in simple pleasures and vibrant moments, whether dancing to my
          favorite tunes, exploring nature's wonders, or sharing laughter with
          friends. I seize each moment as an opportunity to create cherished
          memories and bask in the warmth of happiness. Just as coding fuels my
          intellect, these moments of joy nourish my soul, reminding me of
          life's beautiful balance between work and play...`;

//   Coding is not just
//   a skill, its a passion. With each line of code the rhythm flows at the
//   thought of the project i am working on, fueling my endless quest for
//   knowledge, excellence and innovation. Just as an artist paints and a
//   sculptor carves, I code to unravel complexities and forge pathways to
//   endless possibilities.
